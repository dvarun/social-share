Intranet Content and Data Sharing tool

The Social File Sharing System is a web based system that seeks to emulate Dropbox in the realm of file sharing with a taste of social networking. The system will provide facilities to create groups that pertain to files of a particular nature and theme and users interested in the theme of the group can join these groups and upload and download files to and from these groups respectively. The core aspect of this project is to provide for file sharing without the weight of other communication modules inherent in most social network systems.
